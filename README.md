The DIY-**Noko Monster**, lovely and naughty, ready to build on your own. And everyone is invited to **contribute**. Noko is for everyone. What's new? See the [newsblog](https://github.com/NikolaiRadke/Noko/tree/master/NEWS.md).

Noko is a multifunctional monster with an ATmega328  microcontroller on an **Arduino Nano**, display, clock, radio, mp3 player, four buttons as user interface, battery, voice set and  tons of gimmicks, packed in a cuddly monster suit - sturdy,
lovely and sometimes a bit mean and annoying. Just the way you want him to be. He, she or it - this is your decision     and only depends on the voice set. In this repository Noko is a lad, a real bloke! A buddy for life and a companion by day and night. All he needs is a little power every now and then.  

**Noko** stands for **No**ra and ni**ko**'s monster.

### Notes for non-German Noko makers
There are a German and an English version. Right now, the building wiki, the voice set, the manual and the optional EEPROM text files are in German. I'll try to translate the wiki and the manual one day. Until then, feel free to ask me for translation, if you need help. **Contribute!** I need an English voice set and English text files. In addition, any other language is welcome, Noko is to be cosmopolitan!

### Prerequisites
Noko needs Arduino IDE 1.6.6 - [1.8.2](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) Copy the folder `Noko/V10/src/[language]/Noko/` into your sketch folder. When using 1.6.10 or newer with AVR core 1.6.12 or newer, everything will compile out-of-the-box. With 1.6.9 or lower, *Noko.ino* won't compile, the sketch size is too large. 

**Option 1:** Install newest  [IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) and relax.  
**Option 2:** If you are using IDE 1.6.9 or lower, you need to install [Optiboot](https://github.com/Optiboot/optiboot) onto your Nano.  
**Option 3:** Take one of the precompiled hex-files and follow the instructions in [how to compile](https://github.com/NikolaiRadke/Noko/tree/master/howto_compile).  

**In any case, Optiboot is strongly recommended.**

### Let's get started!

Interested in Noko? Great! Let's start here: [German wiki](https://github.com/NikolaiRadke/Noko/wiki).  
English wiki will follow. One day...
